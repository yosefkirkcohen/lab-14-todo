## Making a plan

What will change when I add multiple users?

One USER key, array of users.

I will need a findUser() function that I place inside the getUser().

I will need getUser() to take a username, get an array of users and then use findUser() to return the user.

The setUser() function will also take a username...
Or should I make a setUserArray() function?
setUser() should take an updated 

setToDos() will take a username that will then get used by the helper functions.

So I need to create an empty array with the initial calling of getUser().

Or first, I need to push the newly created 'user object' into my userArray.
